If the cookieUser is set to a username that does not exist in the database, an appropriate error is thrown when trying to create a post or topic

If an invalid topic name is inserted into the url manually, redirect back to topics page with error message

Appropriate user input field is auto focused on page load (eg. can start typing immediately when loading topics or posts pages)

Topic/Forum pages stay on the most recent posts when creating more posts than displayed

Topic/Forum pages stay on the currently selected page when sorting columns (and the sort applies to all table rows, not just the 5/10 displayed)

Next/Prev in Topics and Forum buttons are disabled when reaching the min or max page

Pager displayed page counts increase/decrease dynamically

Sign Up Now button on homepage CTA only displays if not logged in already

Header truncates text when inside a topic with a long name




I think some error message positioning could have been better (eg. auto redirect on invalid topic name) but it is what it is
Would have liked to move more code into their own files (eg. checking if user logged in) but had to move on to other assignments
